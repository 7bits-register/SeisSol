SeisSol is a software package for simulating wave propagation and dynamic
rupture based on the arbitrary high-order accurate derivative discontinuous
Galerkin method (ADER-DG).

Characteristics of the SeisSol simulation software are:

- use of tetrahedral meshes
- to approximate complex 3D model geometries and rapid model generation
- use of elastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic material to approximate realistic geological subsurface properties
- use of arbitrarily high approximation order in time and space
- to produce reliable and sufficiently accurate synthetic seismograms or other seismological data set
